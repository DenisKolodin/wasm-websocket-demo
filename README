build with
$ cargo build --target=wasm32-unknown-emscripten --release

# remember to use cargo's path as well
export PATH=/home/chrysn/.cargo/bin:/home/chrysn/emsdk-portable:/home/chrysn/emsdk-portable/clang/fastcomp/build_incoming_64/bin:/home/chrysn/emsdk-portable/node/4.1.1_64bit/bin:/home/chrysn/emsdk-portable/emscripten/incoming:$PATH
export EMSDK=/home/chrysn/emsdk-portable
export EMSCRIPTEN=/home/chrysn/emsdk-portable/emscripten/incoming
export EM_CONFIG=$PWD/.emscripten
